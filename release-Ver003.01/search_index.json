Honoring Memory Only Reset Control and correct MOR spec imlementation","keywords":"","body":"20. Honoring Memory Only Reset Control and correct MOR spec implementation\nDisclosure Time line\n\nJuly 2015 – Initial notification to affected parties (this document)\nMid-September 2015 - Patches committed to open source, as needed\nJanuary 2016 – Public advisories added to open source projects, as needed\n\nNOTE: Disclosure plan has been updated in revision 1.2 to allow 6 months before public disclosure, as\nrequested. Product and open source updates should nonetheless strive to address the issue more rapidly,\nif possible.\nThis disclosure plan is designed to enable affected parties sufficient time to deploy mitigation for these\nissues prior to any planned public disclosure.\nBackground\nIn EDK II source code, some infrastructure exists for the Memory Overwrite Request (MOR) capability,\nwhich allows an OS to request that memory be cleared upon reboot (see the TCG Platform Reset Attack\nMitigation Specification Version 1.00, Revision .92 or later). Revision 1.00 is strongly encouraged,\nincluding implementation of detecting an orderly OS shutdown to prevent unnecessary memory clear\noperations. This is a standard published by the Trusted Computing Group and required by some\noperating systems, such as Microsoft Windows.\nThe EDK II infrastructure for this capability is implemented in the SecurityPkg, as described in page 15 of\nA Tour Beyond BIOS: Implementing TPM2 Support in EDKII. This generic code can signal to the platform\nthat there must be a ‘clear’ operation, but the underlying platform implementation of the memory clear\nis often in closed source platform and SI-vendor specific code. In the case of EDK II, the signal is\nimplemented with a UEFI variable. EDK II provides code to initialize, set, and reset the variable, but there\nalso needs to be platform-specific code to honor the signal and perform the clear operation.\nIssue -1\nWe have discovered that, on some platforms, the signal to clear memory is not honored. This could be\nbecause the platform-specific code to do the clear is not implemented or because the firmware fails to\ninvoke this code correctly. If the MOR signal is not honored, Cold Boot attacks may be able to more\neasily reveal encryption keys or other secrets from OS runtime.\nRecommendation -1\nFirmware developers who base code on EDK II should review their implementation for this issue and\ncorrect it, if needed. Where changes to open source are needed, Intel is recommending an embargo\naccording to the timeline above.\nHere is some sample code for an EDKII-style PEI Platform code that can do the clear:\nStatus = VariableServices->PeiGetVariable (\n          PeiServices,\n          EfiMemoryOverwriteControlVariable,\n          &gEfiMemoryOverwriteControlDataGuid,\n          NULL,\n          &VarSize,\n          &MemoryOverwriteReq\n          );\nif (!EFI_ERROR(Status)) {\n// Set a Bit to tell Memory reference code to zeroize memory w/ hardware engine\n// or perform the zeroize operation in software\n}\n\nThe actual clear operation will depend upon the platform type, so the above example only has a placeholder\nwithin the non-error path to insert the appropriate codes.\nImplementation on Quark http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.bios.edk2.devel/7022 \n\nNOTE TO PUBLICATIONS:  Need to decide if we should await MinnowBoard Max applying HSD 216056  this fix (Fixed in Release 91 of MinnowBoard MAX) now that the 1/16 embargo from USRT has passed.   Also, maybe replace above code sample w/ the Galileo impl?\n\nIssue – 2\nDocument\n\nTCG Platform Rest Attack Mitigation Specification \n  Secification Version 1.00 \n  Revision 1.00\n  May 15, 2008\n  Pulished \n\nReads on having the implementation do the following:\n\nSetVariable may be modified to disallow deletion of this UEFI variable, and to disallow a change in its attributes.\n\nthis was not the case in the MOR driver for the last several years.  \nRepro steps:\n\nSet BIOS /BIOS/Intel advanced menu/TPM configuration/Current TPM device = dTPM 2.0 \nSet BIOS /BIOS/Boot maintenance menu/Secure boot configuration/Attempt Secure boot = checked \nRestart the system\nRun the command 'setvar MemoryOverwriteRequestControl -guid E20939BE-32D4-41BE-A150-897F85D49829 -nv -bs -rt = 01' in EFI_shell\nRun the command 'dmpstore -b -d -guid E20939BE-32D4-41BE-A150-897F85D49829' in EFI_shell\nresult should could be a failure\n\nRecommendation – 2\nThis gap was addressed along w/ the implementation of the new feature described in https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt270973(v=vs.85).aspx in the EDKII implementation \nMORLOCK2 checked in at EDK2 SVN  https://sourceforge.net/p/edk2/code/19690\nRecommend implementations pick up the above patch.\nAcknowledgments\nThis first issue was initially reported by Jeremiah Cox of Microsoft Corporation.

DHCP misses boundary check for network packet\nDescription:\nThe UEFI DHCP Protocol has many conventions for processing and caching incoming DHCP4/DHCP6 packets. Their current exists a check in PxeBcCacheDhcp4Packet before calling CopyMem() on two EFI_DHCP4_PACKET structs.\nThis check uses an ASSERT which will be compiled out for RELEASE builds of UEFI on EDK II. \nBut actually, the source is from an external network, and there is no guarantee that the source Length is smaller than destination size. It might happen.\nRecommendation:\n\nFor this specific issue, we need remove ASSERT and use error checking.\nclarify the rule, ASSERT can only be used for something never happen. Error check must be used for something might happen.\n\nThis is addressed by EDK2 GIT \n4f6b33b460226bc1a54d8af2c0f4fe195f2f04ce, 632dcfd6857b6211ce3fe9755d3c11e74ef5d4477, 471342bbefaac1c21fe7fa4e80949b552b12fbdd, a35dc6499beb0b76c340379a06dff74a8d38095a.\nAcknowledgements:\nReported by Timzen, Topher topher.timzen@intel.com\nReferences:\n•    USRT M1622\n"},"smmcore_comm_buffer_check_has_toctou_issue.html":{"url":"smmcore_comm_buffer_check_has_toctou_issue.html","title":"26. SmmCore comm buffer check has TOCTOU issue","keywords":"","body":"26. SmmCore comm buffer check has TOCTOU issue\nDescription:\nA SMM communication buffer is used for data exchange between the SMM component and the non-SMM component. The malicious non-SMM component may generate a malicious SMM communication buffer to attack the SMM component.\nIn order to resist this attack, the SMM component need validate the SMM communication buffer before use it. The validation need cover if the SMM communication buffer overlaps with the SMRAM.\nThe data to be validated should be copied into SMRAM as local variable to avoid Time-Of-Check/Time-Of-Use attack. If the data is not copied into SMRAM, the validation can be bypassed.\nFor example, a malicious software may let an Application Processor (AP) be outside SMRAM, and only let a Bootstrap Processor (BSP) be inside SMRAM. After the BSP performs the check for the communication buffer, the AP modified the communication buffer. Then when the BSP uses the communication buffer later, the BSP is attacked and the check is actually bypassed.\nSee MdeModulePkg/Core/PiSmmCore/PiSmmCore.c:\nThe function InternalIsBufferOverlapped and SmmIsBufferOutsideSmmValid are the checker. They validate gSmmCorePrivate->CommunicationBuffer and gSmmCorePrivate->BufferSize\nHowever these data are outside SMRAM, the malicious code may modify them after check.\nSo below code may still get wrong gSmmCorePrivate->CommunicationBuffer.\nRecommendation:\nWe need copy gSmmCorePrivate->CommunicationBuffer and gSmmCorePrivate->BufferSize to be a local variable, then check and use them, finally sync local variable back to outside SMRAM.\nBecause the BufferSize is moved to SMRAM by SmmCore, the SMM driver should not check the address for the BufferSize.    \nThis is addressed by EDK2 GIT eaae7b33b1cf6b9f21db1636f219c2b6a8d88afd, 62016c1e898434a0326f658912b1e7e0a9c5575e.\nAcknowledgments:\nReported by Yao, Jiewen jiewen.yao@intel.com\nReferences:\n•    USRT M1636\n"}}}

After summation, the final value is multiplied by a static size and used to calculate\nthe size of allocation. This allocation, upon integer overflow, can be small, while the loop that copies\ndata based on values from the capsule will copy a large amount of data.\nAdditionally, the CapsuleCoalesce function also contained an integer overflow during summation of the size of the image and descriptor. This also results in a small allocation but a large copy.\nRecommendation:\nThese issues are addressed by SVN  https://sourceforge.net/p/edk2/code/15136 and  https://sourceforge.net/p/edk2/code/15137.\nAcknowledgements:\nReported by Corey Kallenberg, Xeno Kovah, John Butterworth, and Sam Cornwell of the MITRE Corporation.\nReferences:\n• CERT/CC VU#552286\n"},"boot_failure_related_to_tpm_measurements.html":{"url":"boot_failure_related_to_tpm_measurements.html","title":"16.

Buffer Overflow in Variable Reclaim \nDescription:\nThe Reclaim function that performs garbage collection on the UEFI variable storage area in flash contained a bug that allowed it to search beyond the bounds of the variable storage area. In this circumstance, a buffer overflow may occur. This may result in elevation of privilege or denial of service.\nNOTE: This issue would not normally be exposed. In order to exploit this issue, a separate vulnerability must allow modification of the variable storage area and regions after it, normally stored on SPI flash.\nHowever, because the existing implementation depended upon data outside the variable store, this was considered a security issue and mitigated in code that is intended to be used in production.\nRecommendation:\nThe issue was initially reported in FSVariable.c, which is not intended for use in production. EDK2 SVN https://sourceforge.net/p/edk2/code/16217 and https://sourceforge.net/p/edk2/code/16218 introduce comments to clarify that the code is not intended for production use.\nUpdates to the Reclaim function in MdeModulePkg and SecurityPkg in EDK2 were made in EDK2 SVN https://sourceforge.net/p/edk2/code/16280.\nAcknowledgments:\nReported by Rafal Wojtczuk from Bromium and Corey Kallenberg from MITRE.\nReferences:\n•    CERT/CC VU#533140\n•    USRT M1247\n"},"overflow_in_processing_of_authvarkeydatabase.html":{"url":"overflow_in_processing_of_authvarkeydatabase.html","title":"18.

Overflow in Processing of AuthVarKeyDatabase \nDescription:\nWhen the UEFI Variable AuthVarKeyDatabase is used, it may be possible to overflow a statically allocated buffer.\nRecommendation:\nThe variable AuthVarKeyDatabase is an authenticated variable. Its contents may not be changed without access to an authorized private key. This limits the severity of the issue.\nEDK2 maintainers have assessed that this issue violates the threat model and does not require explicit mitigation. This issue requires an attacker to introduce inconsistency into internal data structures in the variable storage area. The EDK2 architecture requires internal data structures to be protected in implementation. An attacker capable of bypassing this protection may introduce many other inconsistencies. EDK2 SVN https://sourceforge.net/p/edk2/code/16227 added a comment to the source file in order to clarify this.\nAcknowledgments:\nReported by Rafal Wojtczuk from Bromium and Corey Kallenberg from MITRE.\nReferences:\n•    USRT M1246\n"},"counter_based_authenticated_variable_issue.html":{"url":"counter_based_authenticated_variable_issue.html","title":"19.

Honoring Memory Only Reset Control and correct MOR spec implementation\nDisclosure Time line\n\nJuly 2015 – Initial notification to affected parties (this document)\nMid-September 2015 - Patches committed to open source, as needed\nJanuary 2016 – Public advisories added to open source projects, as needed\n\nNOTE: Disclosure plan has been updated in revision 1.2 to allow 6 months before public disclosure, as\nrequested. Product and open source updates should nonetheless strive to address the issue more rapidly,\nif possible.\nThis disclosure plan is designed to enable affected parties sufficient time to deploy mitigation for these\nissues prior to any planned public disclosure.\nBackground\nIn EDK II source code, some infrastructure exists for the Memory Overwrite Request (MOR) capability,\nwhich allows an OS to request that memory be cleared upon reboot (see the TCG Platform Reset Attack\nMitigation Specification Version 1.00, Revision .92 or later). Revision 1.00 is strongly encouraged,\nincluding implementation of detecting an orderly OS shutdown to prevent unnecessary memory clear\noperations. This is a standard published by the Trusted Computing Group and required by some\noperating systems, such as Microsoft Windows.\nThe EDK II infrastructure for this capability is implemented in the SecurityPkg, as described in page 15 of\nA Tour Beyond BIOS: Implementing TPM2 Support in EDKII. This generic code can signal to the platform\nthat there must be a ‘clear’ operation, but the underlying platform implementation of the memory clear\nis often in closed source platform and SI-vendor specific code. In the case of EDK II, the signal is\nimplemented with a UEFI variable. EDK II provides code to initialize, set, and reset the variable, but there\nalso needs to be platform-specific code to honor the signal and perform the clear operation.\nIssue -1\nWe have discovered that, on some platforms, the signal to clear memory is not honored. This could be\nbecause the platform-specific code to do the clear is not implemented or because the firmware fails to\ninvoke this code correctly. If the MOR signal is not honored, Cold Boot attacks may be able to more\neasily reveal encryption keys or other secrets from OS runtime.\nRecommendation -1\nFirmware developers who base code on EDK II should review their implementation for this issue and\ncorrect it, if needed. Where changes to open source are needed, Intel is recommending an embargo\naccording to the timeline above.\nHere is some sample code for an EDKII-style PEI Platform code that can do the clear:\nStatus = VariableServices->PeiGetVariable (\n          PeiServices,\n          EfiMemoryOverwriteControlVariable,\n          &gEfiMemoryOverwriteControlDataGuid,\n          NULL,\n          &VarSize,\n          &MemoryOverwriteReq\n          );\nif (!EFI_ERROR(Status)) {\n// Set a Bit to tell Memory reference code to zeroize memory w/ hardware engine\n// or perform the zeroize operation in software\n}\n\nThe actual clear operation will depend upon the platform type, so the above example only has a placeholder\nwithin the non-error path to insert the appropriate codes.\nImplementation on Quark http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.bios.edk2.devel/7022 \n\nNOTE TO PUBLICATIONS:  Need to decide if we should await MinnowBoard Max applying HSD 216056  this fix (Fixed in Release 91 of MinnowBoard MAX) now that the 1/16 embargo from USRT has passed.   Also, maybe replace above code sample w/ the Galileo impl?\n\nIssue – 2\nDocument\n\nTCG Platform Rest Attack Mitigation Specification \n  Secification Version 1.00 \n  Revision 1.00\n  May 15, 2008\n  Pulished \n\nReads on having the implementation do the following:\n\nSetVariable may be modified to disallow deletion of this UEFI variable, and to disallow a change in its attributes.\n\nthis was not the case in the MOR driver for the last several years.  \nRepro steps:\n\nSet BIOS /BIOS/Intel advanced menu/TPM configuration/Current TPM device = dTPM 2.0 \nSet BIOS /BIOS/Boot maintenance menu/Secure boot configuration/Attempt Secure boot = checked \nRestart the system\nRun the command 'setvar MemoryOverwriteRequestControl -guid E20939BE-32D4-41BE-A150-897F85D49829 -nv -bs -rt = 01' in EFI_shell\nRun the command 'dmpstore -b -d -guid E20939BE-32D4-41BE-A150-897F85D49829' in EFI_shell\nresult should could be a failure\n\nRecommendation – 2\nThis gap was addressed along w/ the implementation of the new feature described in https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt270973(v=vs.85).aspx in the EDKII implementation \nMORLOCK2 checked in at EDK2 SVN  https://sourceforge.net/p/edk2/code/19690\nRecommend implementations pick up the above patch.\nAcknowledgments\nThis first issue was initially reported by Jeremiah Cox of Microsoft Corporation.

OPAL driver has PP issue on BlockSid\nDescription:\nEDKII open source has OPAL driver at SecurityPkg\\Tcg\\Opal. It includes a feature named BlockSid, which is defined in TCG Physical Presence and TCG OPAL BlockSid specification.\nThe TCG PP spec defines PP opcode to enable/disableBlockSid, which may need user confirmation. However, current EDKII OPAL driver just uses a normal variable (OPAL_EXTRA_INFO_VAR_NAME/gOpalExtraInfoVariableGuid) to store the BlockSid enable/disable.\nThis driver does not follow TCG recommendation to use PP process to request user confirmation on BlockSid state change.\nAlso this variable is NOT locked. It means any one can overwrite this variable and bypass BlockSid operation.\nRecommendation:\nWe had better follow TCG PP specification, and implement TCG storage operation (96~101). So that:\n\nUser confirmation is needed when BlockSid state is changed. (This follows TCG PP spec)\nThis BlockSid state is still saved into variable, but the variable is locked via EDKII_VARIABLE_LOCK_PROTOCOL (This makes sure no malicious code may modify BlockSid enable/disable state.)\n\nThis is addressed by EDK2 GIT e92ddda2b547f0b952935abaf44fd72e97dbf755..4e3b05a49f454bc257252ae9090421e3c8447737, \nbee13c00218f3ed3118d8d87683c11b31ca04564, 01dd077315c6759c94af9af4232f8318db13cf8d.\nAcknowledgments:\nReported by Yao, Jiewen jiewen.yao@intel.com.\nReferences:\n\nUSRT M1620\nTCG PC Client Platform Physical Presence Interface Specification\nTCG Storage Feature Set: Block SID Authentication\n\n"},"opal_driver_has_psid_issue.html":{"url":"opal_driver_has_psid_issue.html","title":"24.

OPAL driver has PSID issue\nDescription:\nEDKII open source has OPAL driver at SecurityPkg\\Tcg\\Opal. It includes a feature named PSID. PSID is a hard driver specific key which is used to revert to factory default mode. This PSID value should be kept as secret.\nCurrent EDKII OPAL driver does not clear PSID in memory after use. The secret value is left in stack, or global variable memory without clear.\nTechnically, a malicious program may search memory and find out the PSID in memory, if user inputs the PSID value in BIOS.\nRecommendation:\n\nTo fix this specific issue, OPAL driver should call ZeroMem() to clear PSID in memory after it is used.\nAs generic rule, if a password or other secret is used in a driver, this driver should call ZeroMem() to clear secret in memory after it is used.\n\nThis is addressed by EDK2 GIT e92ddda2b547f0b952935abaf44fd72e97dbf755..4e3b05a49f454bc257252ae9090421e3c8447737, \nbee13c00218f3ed3118d8d87683c11b31ca04564, 01dd077315c6759c94af9af4232f8318db13cf8d. \nAcknowledgments:\nReported by Yao, Jiewen jiewen.yao@intel.com.\nReferences:\n•    USRT M1619\n"},"dhcp_misses_boundary_check_for_network_packet.html":{"url":"dhcp_misses_boundary_check_for_network_packet.html","title":"25.

DHCP misses boundary check for network packet\nDescription:\nThe UEFI DHCP Protocol has many conventions for processing and caching incoming DHCP4/DHCP6 packets. Their current exists a check in PxeBcCacheDhcp4Packet before calling CopyMem() on two EFI_DHCP4_PACKET structs.\nThis check uses an ASSERT which will be compiled out for RELEASE builds of UEFI on EDK II. \nBut actually, the source is from an external network, and there is no guarantee that the source Length is smaller than destination size. It might happen.\nRecommendation:\n\nFor this specific issue, we need remove ASSERT and use error checking.\nclarify the rule, ASSERT can only be used for something never happen. Error check must be used for something might happen.\n\nThis is addressed by EDK2 GIT \n4f6b33b460226bc1a54d8af2c0f4fe195f2f04ce, 632dcfd6857b6211ce3fe9755d3c11e74ef5d4477, 471342bbefaac1c21fe7fa4e80949b552b12fbdd, a35dc6499beb0b76c340379a06dff74a8d38095a.\nAcknowledgements:\nReported by Timzen, Topher topher.timzen@intel.com\nReferences:\n•    USRT M1622\n"},"smmcore_comm_buffer_check_has_toctou_issue.html":{"url":"smmcore_comm_buffer_check_has_toctou_issue.html","title":"26.

SmmCore comm buffer check has TOCTOU issue\nDescription:\nA SMM communication buffer is used for data exchange between the SMM component and the non-SMM component. The malicious non-SMM component may generate a malicious SMM communication buffer to attack the SMM component.\nIn order to resist this attack, the SMM component need validate the SMM communication buffer before use it. The validation need cover if the SMM communication buffer overlaps with the SMRAM.\nThe data to be validated should be copied into SMRAM as local variable to avoid Time-Of-Check/Time-Of-Use attack. If the data is not copied into SMRAM, the validation can be bypassed.\nFor example, a malicious software may let an Application Processor (AP) be outside SMRAM, and only let a Bootstrap Processor (BSP) be inside SMRAM. After the BSP performs the check for the communication buffer, the AP modified the communication buffer. Then when the BSP uses the communication buffer later, the BSP is attacked and the check is actually bypassed.\nSee MdeModulePkg/Core/PiSmmCore/PiSmmCore.c:\nThe function InternalIsBufferOverlapped and SmmIsBufferOutsideSmmValid are the checker. They validate gSmmCorePrivate->CommunicationBuffer and gSmmCorePrivate->BufferSize\nHowever these data are outside SMRAM, the malicious code may modify them after check.\nSo below code may still get wrong gSmmCorePrivate->CommunicationBuffer.\nRecommendation:\nWe need copy gSmmCorePrivate->CommunicationBuffer and gSmmCorePrivate->BufferSize to be a local variable, then check and use them, finally sync local variable back to outside SMRAM.\nBecause the BufferSize is moved to SMRAM by SmmCore, the SMM driver should not check the address for the BufferSize.    \nThis is addressed by EDK2 GIT eaae7b33b1cf6b9f21db1636f219c2b6a8d88afd, 62016c1e898434a0326f658912b1e7e0a9c5575e.\nAcknowledgments:\nReported by Yao, Jiewen jiewen.yao@intel.com\nReferences:\n•    USRT M1636\n"},"uefi-variable-deletioncorruption.html":{"url":"uefi-variable-deletioncorruption.html","title":"27.
